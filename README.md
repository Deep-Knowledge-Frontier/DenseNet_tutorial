Densenet-Tensorflow

This code uses Cifar10, Mnist dataset. 

Usually, Image data is 2-dimension or 3-dimension data. Financial data is 1-dimension. Therefore, it doesn't seem to fit CNN agorithm which is usually for image data. However, CNN fitering (Kernerning) method could also use 1-dimension data.
